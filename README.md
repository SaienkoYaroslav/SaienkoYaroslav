- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SaienkoYaroslav, 31 yo, Ukraine, Kyiv
- ðŸ‘€ I have been studying Android development for 3 years. I have 9 months of commercial experience at NLA company. I worked both in-office and remotely. I have experience with Jira, Slack, and Figma. I started learning Android with JAVA, transitioned to Kotlin in 2022, and worked with Compose in the latest project at the company. I understand the development process and can communicate with other departments to achieve results. I have been continuously learning new technologies. I believe no task that cannot be accomplished. I am looking for a company where my skills will be useful and where I can continue to grow as a specialist to contribute to the future.
