- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SaienkoYaroslav, 32 yo, Ukraine, Kyiv
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an Android Developer with 2 year of commercial experience and a solid foundation in both Java and Kotlin. Iâ€™ve worked in both office and remote teams, building and maintaining production-level apps using modern tools like Jetpack Compose, Room, and Hilt. I take ownership of my work, communicate well across teams, and constantly seek to improve my skills. I'm looking for a company where I can bring value, grow professionally, and contribute to building high-quality mobile products.
